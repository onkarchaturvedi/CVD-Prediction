# CVD-Prediction
cardiovascular heart disease prediction model using hybrid machine learning with feature selection. this model performs well most of datasets, we have used randomforestclassifier, neural network, and gradiant boosting to create an ensembled learning model


this repo contains 3 files 
1- cvd-model.ipynb :- This is the official jupyter file in which all the working has done, all the algos has been performed in this file. run it for once and at the end you will have your own pkl file. which will be loaded automatically to the gui...

2- gui-cvd.py- after generating your model with cvd-model.ipynb file you have to run the gui file for a graphical user interface. this will open a popup of gui interface

3- Dataset Information(heart.csv) :- Heart Disease Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. 

NOTE:- to make this code work make sure you have all the files in the same folder. the files name is as followed
1- cvd-model.ipynb
2- model1167.pkl(which will be automatically generated when you run the cvd-model.ipynb)
3- gui-cvd.py
4- heart.csv


now i am sharing the pip commands for the libraries used in this project

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn joblib

copy the above line in your vs code compiler or any other ide you are using

this project is created as our normal collage project by onkar chaturvedi
you are allowed to use this model for individual purpose not for commercial purpose.

you can not claim this as your own project legally but you are allowed to use it or to submit it in your collage project...

anyways enjoy !! wishing you health and happiness...
